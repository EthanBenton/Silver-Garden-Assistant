# Problem Statement

- How can gardeners efficiently monitor moisture and nutrient levels?

- What strategies can a gardener use to optimize their techniques for healthier plants?

- How can gardeners minimize water usage while also making sure that their plants are getting adequate water?


# Problem Characteristics

- Surge of new gardeners coming from the COVID pandemic.

- Uptick in people wanting to learn about homesteading, and or being self sufficient.
Learning the appropriate skills to properly maintain garden.

# Solution Statement

- We aim to provide gardeners with the necessary tools to know when to plant, manage nutrients and water content in the soil, and better improve their gardening capabilities while improving their plant’s health and growth.

# Solution Characteristics

- Using a Single-Board Computer (SBC), in our case, a Raspberry Pi.

- Using a physical sensor to detect soil moisture, temperature, light, etc.

- Creating programmable software to execute on the SBC that would help process, store, and visualize the data acquired from the sensors.
