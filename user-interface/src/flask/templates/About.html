            PRIA is a self-hosted web application garden management system to aid gardeners, either new or experienced. 
            We aim to provide gardeners with the necessary tools to know when to plant, manage nutrients and water content in the soil,
            and better improve their gardening capabilities while improving their plantâ€™s health and growth.
