                First, data is collected on the weather and the plants then passed to the IOT sensors.
                Next, it is ran into a MCU and then stored into SQLite, a database. 
                Following the storing of the data Pandas and NumPy is to format the data.
                Once the data is uniformly sorted, PyTorch and Scikit start the machine learning process.
                After feeding the data into machine learning it is simultaneously being visualized with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly
                while using regression models and reinforcement learning to help predict future trends and adjust for the best results.
                Finally, the data has been collected, processed and visualized. 
                Feedback is provided on the user interface using flask and react.
