        <h2>What is PRIA</h2>
        <p>
          PRIA is a self-hosted web application garden management system to aid gardeners, 
          either new or experienced. It aims to provide gardeners with the necessary tools to 
          know when to plant, manage nutrients and water content in the soil, and better improve 
          their gardening capabilities while improving their plantâ€™s health and growth.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          First, data is collected on the weather and the plants then passed to the IOT sensors. 
          Next, it is ran into a MCU and then stored into SQLite, a database. Following the 
          storing of the data Pandas and NumPy is to format the data. Once the data is uniformly 
          sorted, PyTorch and Scikit start the machine learning process. After feeding the data 
          into machine learning it is simultaneously being visualized with Matplotlib, Seaborn 
          and Plotly while using regression models and reinforcement learning to help predict 
          future trends and adjust for the best results. Finally, the data has been collected, 
          processed and visualized. Feedback is provided on the user interface using flask and react.
